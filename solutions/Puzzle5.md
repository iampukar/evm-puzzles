## Analysis 

Let's break down the bytecode and understand the flow of execution to find the answer:

1. `CALLVALUE (34)`: This opcode gets the value sent with the transaction and pushes it onto the stack.

2. `DUP1 (80)`: Duplicates the top value of the stack.

3. `MUL (02)`: Multiplies the top two values on the stack and pushes the result back onto the stack.

4. `PUSH2 0100`: Pushes the value 0100 (256 in decimal) onto the stack.

5. `EQ (14)`: Compares the top two values on the stack for equality. If equals, it pushes 1 (true) onto the stack; otherwise, it pushes 0 (false).

6. `PUSH1 0C`: Pushes the value 0C (12 in decimal) onto the stack.

7. `JUMPI (57)`: If the top value of the stack is true (1), it alters the program counter to the value beneath it (in this case, 0C), performing a conditional jump to the JUMPDEST at byte 0C.

8. `JUMPDEST (5B)`: Marks a valid destination for jumps.

9. `STOP (00)`: Halts execution.

## Execution

For the `JUMPI` at `byte 09` to jump to the `JUMPDEST` at `byte 0C`, the result of the `EQ` operation must be `true`.

- CALLVALUE: Let's call the value to send as `X`
- DUP1: Stack now has two `X`
- MUL: `X` * `X`
- PUSH2 0100: `0100` is pushed to stack, or 256 (in decimal)
- EQ: (because next set of op-code is `JUMPI` )
        
        X * X = 256 
        (X)^2 = 256 
        X = 16
