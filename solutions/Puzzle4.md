## Analysis 

Let's break down the bytecode and understand the flow of execution to find the answer:

1. `CALLVALUE (34)`: This opcode gets the value sent with the transaction and pushes it onto the stack.

2. `CODESIZE (38)`: This opcode pushes the size of the code (in bytes) onto the stack.

3. `XOR (18)`: This opcode performs a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) between the top two values on the stack and pushes the result back onto the stack. In this case, it will XOR V (CALLVALUE) and 0C (CODESIZE).

4. `JUMP (56)`: This opcode alters the program counter to the location specified by the top stack item. It jumps to the location if it's a valid `JUMPDEST`.

5. `JUMPDEST (5B)`: Marks a valid destination for jumps.

6. `STOP (00)`: Halts execution.

## Execution

- The XOR operation at byte 02 will XOR the values `V` and `0C`.
- For the JUMP at `byte 03` to be successful, the result of the XOR operation must be `0A`, which is the address of JUMPDEST.

- The XOR operation can be expressed as:

        V XOR 0C = 0A (hex)
        V = 0A XOR 0C
        V = 10 XOR 12 (dec)

        10: 00001100 (binary)
        12: 00001010 (binary)
