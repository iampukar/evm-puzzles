## Analysis

1. `CALLVALUE (34)`:
   - This opcode pushes the value of Ether (in wei) sent with the transaction onto the stack.

2. `JUMP (56)`:
   - This opcode alters the program counter to the location specified by the top stack item. In this case, it will jump to the byte location equal to the transaction value.

3. `REVERT (FD)` (multiple instances):
   - These opcodes will revert the transaction if reached.

4. `JUMPDEST (5B)` at `08`:
   - This opcode marks a valid destination for a jump.

5. `STOP (00)` at `09`:
   - This opcode halts execution.

## Execution

- The execution must jump to the `JUMPDEST` at `08` and not hit any `REVERT` opcodes.
- This means the transaction value, which is pushed onto the stack by `CALLVALUE`, must be such that the `JUMP` opcode jumps directly to the `JUMPDEST` at `08`.

## Solution:
- The value to send with the transaction should be `08` (in hexadecimal), which is `8` in decimal.
- Sending a transaction with a value of `8` wei will cause the `JUMP` at `01` to go to the `JUMPDEST` at `08`, avoiding all `REVERT` opcodes and successfully halting at `STOP`.

Therefore, you should enter a value of `8` wei to solve this puzzle.
