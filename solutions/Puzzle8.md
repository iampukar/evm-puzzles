## Analysis 

1. `CALLDATASIZE (36)`: Pushes the size of the calldata onto the stack.

2. `PUSH1 00 (6000)`: Pushes the value `00` onto the stack.

3. `DUP1 (80)`: Duplicates the top value of the stack.

4. `CALLDATACOPY (37)`: Copies the calldata into memory using destination offset, source offset, and length from the stack.

5. `PUSH1 00 (6000)` (repeated twice): Pushes `00` onto the stack twice, preparing parameters for `CREATE`.

6. `CREATE (F0)`: Creates a new contract with the calldata as its initialization code.

7. `PUSH1 00 (6000)`, `DUP1 (80)` (repeated four times): Prepares stack for `CALL` with parameters including gas, target address, value, and memory positions.

8. `SWAP5 (94)`: Swaps stack items to place the contract address at the correct position for `CALL`.

9. `GAS (5A)`: Pushes remaining gas onto the stack.

10. `CALL (F1)`: Attempts to call the contract at the address with provided parameters.

11. `PUSH1 00 (6000)`, `EQ (14)`: Checks if the `CALL` operation was unsuccessful (equal to 0).

12. `PUSH1 1B (601B)`, `JUMPI (57)`: Performs a conditional jump to `JUMPDEST` if `CALL` was unsuccessful.

13. `JUMPDEST (5B)`, `STOP (00)`: Marks a valid jump destination and halts execution.

## Execution

- The sequence starts by copying the calldata into memory.
- `CREATE` uses this calldata to deploy a new contract.
- `CALL` then attempts to execute this new contract, with the outcome determining the next steps.
- For the puzzle to be solved, this `CALL` must fail, causing a jump to `JUMPDEST` and then a successful `STOP`.

## Solution 

The solution is to provide calldata that creates a contract that will cause the `CALL` operation to fail. This can be done by deploying a contract that immediately reverts.

- The calldata `0x60FD60005360016000F3` is a sequence of opcodes that results in such a contract:
  
  1. `60FD` (`PUSH1 FD`): Pushes the `REVERT` opcode onto the stack.
  
  2. `6000` (`PUSH1 00`): Pushes the memory offset `00`.
  
  3. `53` (`MSTORE8`): Stores the `REVERT` opcode at the specified memory offset.
  
  4. `6001` (`PUSH1 01`) and `6000` (`PUSH1 00`): Prepare the stack for `RETURN`, specifying the offset and size of the data to return.
  
  5. `F3` (`RETURN`): Returns the `REVERT` opcode as the runtime bytecode of the new contract.

- This calldata ensures that the new contract will `REVERT` any call to it, making the `CALL` operation fail and allowing the execution to jump to `JUMPDEST` and then execute `STOP`.
