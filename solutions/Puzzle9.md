## Analysis 

1. `CALLDATASIZE (36)`: Pushes the size of the calldata (in bytes) onto the stack.

2. `PUSH1 03 (6003)`: Pushes the value `03` onto the stack.

3. `LT (10)`: Compares the calldata size with `03`. Pushes `1` (true) if less than `03`, otherwise `0` (false).

4. `PUSH1 09 (6009)`: Pushes the value `09` onto the stack.

5. `JUMPI (57)`: Conditionally jumps to byte `09` if the top stack item is `1`.

6. `REVERT (FD)`: Reverts the transaction if the jump is not executed.

7. `JUMPDEST (5B)` at `09`: Marks a valid jump destination.

8. `CALLVALUE (34)`: Pushes the value sent with the transaction onto the stack.

9. `CALLDATASIZE (36)`: Pushes the size of the calldata onto the stack again.

10. `MUL (02)`: Multiplies the transaction value and the calldata size.

11. `PUSH1 08 (6008)`: Pushes the value `08` onto the stack.

12. `EQ (14)`: Checks if the multiplication result equals `08`.

13. `PUSH1 14 (6014)`: Pushes the value `14` onto the stack.

14. `JUMPI (57)`: Conditionally jumps to byte `14` if the multiplication result equals `08`.

15. `REVERT (FD)`: Reverts the transaction if the jump is not executed.

16. `JUMPDEST (5B)` at `14`: Marks another valid jump destination.

17. `STOP (00)`: Halts execution.

## Execution

To successfully reach the `STOP` instruction without reverting:

- The calldata size must be greater than or equal to 3 bytes to avoid the first revert.
- The product of the transaction value (`CALLVALUE`) and the calldata size (`CALLDATASIZE`) must equal 8.

## Solution 

To meet these requirements, the calldata size and transaction value need to be chosen such that:

- `CALLDATASIZE` ≥ 3
- `CALLVALUE` × `CALLDATASIZE` = 8

Possible solutions include:

- Calldata: `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` (8 bytes) and Transaction Value: `1 wei`. Here, `CALLDATASIZE` is 8, and the product with `CALLVALUE` (1 wei) equals 8.
- Calldata: `0xFFFFFFFF` (4 bytes) and Transaction Value: `2 wei`. In this case, `CALLDATASIZE` is 4, and the product with `CALLVALUE` (2 wei) also equals 8.

These configurations satisfy both conditions, allowing the bytecode execution to reach the `STOP` opcode successfully.
